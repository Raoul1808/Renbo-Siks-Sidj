A joke Unity game made for April Fools

You need Unity 2018.4.20f1 to run the project. Nothing else needed.

I won't work more on this project, as it was intentionally made short and very, VERY low quality gameplay and graphics. If you wish to change how the game looks and plays, I recommend you start by deleting the PlayerMovement script, or just massively changing it.
